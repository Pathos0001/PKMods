# PKMods
Various mods for Prehistoric Kingdom
Things like adding new textures and placable objects

## TO USE
Either use a mono injector, OR modify the Assembly-CSharp to load the DLL. Preasently I am only using the injection method as it can be reloaded at runtime and is more future-proof. 
After an initial release, I'll add modified Assembly-CSharp DLLS for each release.
The git to the included injector can be found here: https://github.com/Michidu/MonoInjector

After injecting press F1 to pull up the menu.

As of writing, the only funtionality is to save textures.
### TODO
